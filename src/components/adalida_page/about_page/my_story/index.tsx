              shootout in Reserve. &lsquo;In the late 1950s, Walt Disney turned
              Baca into the first Hispanic popular culture hero in the United
              States, representing him in six comic books, a feature film,
              and related merchandising.&rsquo; - Read about him&nbsp;

              In 2020 I graduated from the University of New Mexico with a B.A

              My favorite Philosophy courses included symbolic logic, the

              My English courses focused on technical and professional
              communication which included courses on visual rhetoric, editing,
              an internship with Project ECHO, and an independent study focused
              on designing a website promoting ecological studies at UNM.

              My professor later contracted me to redesign the National
              Consortium of Environmental Rhetoric and Writing website, which
              launched my freelance design business. During this time, I also
              worked as a Student Program Coordinator planning events, designing
              experiences and marketing materials. I helped recharter and was
              elected Vice-President of the Lobo Gardens. Lastly, I was the
              co-winner of the Dale and Melada scholarship award.

              During my winter, summer, fall, and spring breaks I&apos;d visit
              my fianc√© Ricardo in San Francisco, California. During this time I
              worked with Robert Half as an Administrative Assistant in a

              During my last semester of college, Covid started. This turned out
              well for me because I was able to move out to San Francisco a
              semester early while completing my classes and internship with
              Project ECHO remotely.
