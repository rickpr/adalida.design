          I like the company Meow Wolf (we are both New Mexico Native).
          They opened, and then quickly closed, a new location in Las Vegas, Nevada during COVID.
          I wanted to learn user experience design and I wanted to visit the new exhibit, Omega Mart.
          This project was my way of marrying the two while I waited for the re-opening.

          Meow Wolf is an American arts and entertainment company.
          They host interactive non-linear art muesuem with locations in New Mexico, Nevada, and Colorado with day and event tickets.
          They also host music festivals, create large scale art isntallations, and create and produce streaming content.

          Becuase this was my first full UX project, I had very little knowledge and experience conducting
          interviews and building empathy before desiging a product. After, I learned how vital this step is in
          determining the success or failure of your design.

          Having a good information architecture will save you and your userâ€™s time and stress. When I first started
          desiging, I designed from my head to my paper, which resulted in a lot of unused and unncessary desiging and
          some very frustrated users. After developing my architecture, it was easier and more flexable to design.
