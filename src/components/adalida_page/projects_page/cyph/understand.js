          My research focused on how voting works in the United States,
          why people donâ€™t vote, what information is useful to voters,
          and why voting is important.
        </p>

        <p>
          I conducted phone interviews and began empathizing with voters by
          conducting phone interviews and creating user personas.

          After, I conducted a competitive audit and learned about useful
          data sources posted publicly available for use like the Federal
          Election Commitee (FEC) website.

        <p>
          This is also where I began creating my information architecture and a process flow.
