        My research focused on how voting works in the United States,
        why people donâ€™t vote, what information is useful to voters,
        and why voting is important.
      </p>

      <p>
        I conducted phone interviews and began empathizing with voters by creating user personas.
      </p>
      <p>
        After, I created an affinity diagram and conducted a competitive audit where I learned about useful
        data sources posted publicly available for use like the Federal
        Election Committee (FEC) website and common pain points for voters.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is also where I began creating my information architecture.
