            During my winter, summer, fall, and spring breaks I&apos;d visit
            my fianc√© Ricardo in San Francisco, California. During this time I
            worked with Robert Half as an Administrative Assistant in a
            variety of offices like Samsara, World Economic Forum, User
            Testing, the Watermark, and more.

            During my last semester of college, Covid started. This turned out
            well for me because I was able to move out to San Francisco a
            semester early while completing my classes and internship with
            Project ECHO remotely.

            After graduation, I began learning User Experience Design through
            Google&apos;s Coursera courses, a mentor, the Interaction Design
            Foundation, Hackathons, and the clientele I receive from my design
            business.

            As you can see in my portfolio, much of my design clientele is
            contracted from New Mexico.

            I&apos;m designing something for Ricardo to implement via code.
            This website is a great example of our work together. I&apos;m a
            great designer, and he&apos;s an excellent coder so together we
            have a plethora of projects. Currently, we&apos;re developing a
            mobile workout app for ourselves. Check out
