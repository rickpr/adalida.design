        I hold an interdisciplinary B.A. in English-Philosophy with a specialization in Technical and Professional
        Communication. Exploring the intersection of these fields allowed me to study how humans think, communicate, and
        interact. This unique blend enriches my approach to UX design, enabling me to create thoughtful, user-centric
        products. For insights on the intersection of design, philosophy, and language, including my past work,
