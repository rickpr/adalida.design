        <h5>Validating the Prototype:</h5>
        <p>
          To ensure GainTain could support the diverse needs of lifters, I conducted scenario testing, simulating
          real-world use cases to evaluate the prototypeâ€™s versatility.
        </p>
        <p>Research revealed that lifters organize their tracking around three core set types:</p>
        <NumberedList
          items={[
            'Weighted sets: for traditional strength exercises.',
            'Weighted supersets: for routines that combine multiple exercises seamlessly.',
            'Non-weighted sets: for bodyweight movements, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and stretches.',
          ]}
        />
        <p>This design was updated to support different types of tracking, workouts, and practices lifters encounter.</p>
      </section>
