            With limited direct feedback, I leveraged dogfooding as an early validation method and Apple&apos;s SwiftUI
            documentation to refine UI interactions. Moving forward, Iâ€™ll prioritize structured user research and
            participant recruitment for deeper insights.

            Building a greenfield product reinforced the importance of early collaboration with engineering to align UI
            with backend feasibility.
            I learned to prioritize dependencies, manage scope, and adapt quickly to constraints.

        <KeyTakeawayCard title='Developer Collaboration'>
          <p className='caption-1'>
            Testing GainTain in a gym enabled rapid feedback loops. Using Kanban boards and PRDs, I streamlined handoff,
            reduced rework, and improved collaboration.
            Regular check-ins ensured alignment, leading to smoother implementation.
